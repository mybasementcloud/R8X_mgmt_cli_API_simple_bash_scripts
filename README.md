# R8X_mgmt_cli_API_simple_bash_scripts
Collection of simple bash scripts for the Check Point R8x Management API via mgmt_cli

Additional documentation and information will be provided in .md, .tsv, and potentially .xlsx files in the repository folders.

These scripts should run as-is on a Check Point R80+ Management Host (with given limitations) at the command line (CLI) expert shell level via bash.
The scripts will not work at the command line clish shell level, because actual bash scripting.
